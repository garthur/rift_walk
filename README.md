League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed by Riot Games. Over the past years the eSports scene for league has grown significantly, with a global following of millions. In the game, players on a team select five champions with unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The choice of these five champions, and the mindgames and drafts before the games even start are known as the "meta." In this analysis, we treat these champion selections as a network, with each edge between two champtions representing that they have been either picked on the same team, picked on opposing teams, or one was picked and the other banned in a professional match. We seek to understand the nature of this network, the "meta" over time.
